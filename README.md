# Color Keyboard

This Color Keyboard was developed in unity during the month of April 2020

This project was created as the final deliverable for ART 151 at UIC 2020

Millions of people use a keyboard everday without a single thought about how their keyboard is layed out and what each key actually does to interact with their system. Color Keyboard is a demonstration of how a keyboard's layout is arbitrary without a purpose.

The game was developed with the unity engine and C# and is hosted on github pages(https://otny12.github.io/unitygame/)
